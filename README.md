# toc2026
This resource is being developed alongside an undergraduate **Theory of Computation** course taught at [Cummins College of Engineering for Women](https://cumminscollege.org/) (Winter Semester 2026).

At present, this repository is a **scaffold**. Content will be added incrementally.

## Planned Scope (Tentative)

- Finite Automata (DFA, NFA, ε-NFA)
- Regular Languages
- Closure Properties and Decision Algorithms
- Pumping Lemma and Non-Regularity
- Context-Free Grammars and Pushdown Automata
- Turing Machines
- Decidability and Undecidability
- Reductions and Recognizability
- (Possibly) Time and Space Complexity — selectively
